## Major Changes

### 1. Code Organization
- Split the monolithic script into modular components:
  - `generator.py`: Contains the Generator network implementation
  - `discriminator.py`: Contains the Discriminator network implementation
  - `preprocess.py`: Contains image preprocessing functions
  - `run.py`: Main training script that orchestrates the GAN training

### 2. GAN Architecture Changes
- Changed from traditional GAN to WGAN (Wasserstein GAN):
  - Removed sigmoid activation from discriminator output
  - Changed from BCE loss to WGAN loss
  - Implemented weight clipping (clip_value = 0.01)
  - Changed optimizer from Adam to RMSprop
  - Added n_critic parameter (5) for more frequent discriminator updates

### 3. Training Process Changes
- Added mixed precision training support:
  - Implemented torch.amp.GradScaler
  - Added torch.amp.autocast context managers
- Modified loss calculation:
  - Removed BCEWithLogitsLoss
  - Implemented WGAN loss: E[D(x)] - E[D(G(z))]
- Added non-blocking data transfer to GPU
- Implemented set_to_none=True for gradient zeroing

### 4. Preprocessing Changes
- Enhanced image preprocessing:
  - Added random rotation augmentation
  - Improved white pixel handling
  - Added progress bar for processing
  - Implemented caching to avoid reprocessing existing images
  - Added class-specific output directories

### 5. Model Saving
- Enhanced model checkpointing:
  - Added optimizer state saving
  - Separated generator and discriminator weights
  - Added timestamp to saved files

### 6. Performance Optimizations
- Added pin_memory=True to DataLoader
- Implemented non-blocking data transfers
- Added gradient scaling for mixed precision
- Optimized memory usage with set_to_none=True

### 7. Code Quality Improvements
- Added proper error handling
- Improved logging and progress tracking
- Better organization of hyperparameters
- Added type hints and documentation
- Improved file path handling

## Technical Details

### Generator Architecture
- Input: 100-dimensional noise vector
- Output: 64x64x3 image
- Uses transposed convolutions with batch normalization
- Final activation: Tanh

### Discriminator Architecture
- Input: 64x64x3 image
- Output: Single value (no sigmoid)
- Uses convolutions with leaky ReLU
- No batch normalization in first layer

### Training Parameters
- Batch size: 256
- Image size: 64x64
- Learning rate: 0.00005 (RMSprop)
- Number of epochs: 5
- Critic iterations per generator iteration: 5
- Weight clipping value: 0.01

## Results
The WGAN implementation provides more stable training compared to the original GAN, with:
- Better gradient flow
- More consistent loss values
- Improved image quality
- Reduced mode collapse
- Better convergence properties
